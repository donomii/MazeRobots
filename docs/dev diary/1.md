# The start

Well, almost the start.  This is the development diary for my little game project, a “colony simulator” written in a version of scheme called [PLT Racket](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Racket).

I learned Racket a while ago, while it was still called PLT Scheme, and wrote a few simple things in it, including the start of a procedural generation system.  As part of that, I created these little guys.

They hung around on my [website](http://praeceptamachinae.com/) for years, until I got the urge one day to finally make a little colony management game like Dwarf Fortress or Rimworld.


## Get something on screen

Let’s start by getting some figures on screen.

Looks like I’m rotating around the wrong axis there.  I like the look though, I’ll have to add this effect deliberately later.  It reminds me of [this illustration](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paradiso_Canto_31.jpg).

## Walking on a plane

A few vector tweaks later and I have my little figures marching around on an invisible surface.

Now I just have to get them pointed in the right direction…

Oh dear.
