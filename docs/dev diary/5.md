# Moving to 3D

So far, the game engine has been 2D.  Everything occurs on a flat map, and the pathing algorithm only tracked points with (x,y).  There was an awkward conversion into and out of map coordinates as well.

So now I have upgraded everything to 3-vectors, wrote some wrappers to do the conversion so I never have to care about it again, and got a basic 3D pathing test going.  There are clearly some issues with the pathing algorithm.

Not too bad, or so it seems at first.  Those little detours it makes are a consequence of the algorithm.  When it hits a wall, it chooses a neighbouring square that is closest to the goal, in this case, sideways.  But after moving sideways, it discovers there are no more floor squares closer to the goal, so it goes up.  Once it has gone up, it realises that it can get closer by moving sideways, etc.

The bigger problem is that the robot is following the edge of the maze.  It is doing that, because I made a mistake in calculating distances, and at this point, I hadn't noticed it.  But a little bit later, it because very clear that I had a problem.

The problem turned out that I had left some old code in the metric-calculating function.  It was calculating distances correctly in one direction, but not the other.  As a result, running *away* from the goal became "the shorter path".  Very odd.

But now, it works better.  Mostly.

However there is still a problem.  Sometimes, rarely, the game will freeze while calculating a path.  When I inspected it, I discovered it was calculating a very long path.  Why?

This pathing algorithm is good, except sometimes.  It was getting caught in that sometimes.  The trouble with this algorithm is that if it starts going the wrong way, it will continue going the wrong way, searching the entire map before it reaches the goal.  As the map is 100x100, that's a lot of squares to search.  The game locks up waiting for the path algorithm to complete.

There's no way to avoid it now, I need to write an A* search routine.
