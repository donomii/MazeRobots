# Jobs and Camera controls

## Jobs

I continued to improve the jobs system, adding more features, and removing the older, simpler code.  Each figure now has it's own personal job queue.  When that becomes empty, it takes a new job from the global jobs queue.

The jobs system is rapidly approaching the point where I should move it into its own file, but for now it is tangled up in the rendering code.  Hopefully because I wrote it in good functional style, breaking it apart should be easy.

HahahahAHAHAhahaha

## Camera

Happily, I had written some code for spinning the camera in the previous project, so all I had to do was add pan and zoom.  It works really nicely!


![Camera controls](2camera.mov)

Or rather, not that nicely.  It was moving everytime it received a keypress from the operating system.  The trouble with this plan is that there is a short delay before the key starts repeating, and there are not a lot of repeats per second, so the movement looks jumpy.

I could write some complex code to interpolate all this, but the right thing to do is monitor for key down, and key up events.

Like this:

Now the only remaining problem is that the camera position is recalculated each frame, which means that for the user, the camera speed varies with the frame rate.  It would be better to recalculate the camera position a fixed number of times per second, independently of the frame rate.  This will require a significant rewrite, so it will have to wait a bit longer.
