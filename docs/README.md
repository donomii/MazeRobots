# Leap

This is a few graphics related demos I am combining into a small game.  It hoeps to be, one day, a simple colony management/sime builder type game.

Current status:  it can draw mazes and make a little figure run through them.

# Dev diaries

Even more fun than doing the game, is writing about doing the game.  Check out some words
