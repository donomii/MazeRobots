# Jobs and Camera controls

## Jobs

I continued to improve the jobs system, adding more features, and removing the older, simpler code.  Each figure now has it's own personal job queue.  When that becomes empty, it takes a new job from the global jobs queue.

The jobs system is rapidly approaching the point where I should move it into its own file, but for now it is tangled up in the rendering code.  Hopefully because I wrote it in good functional style, breaking it apart should be easy.

HahahahAHAHAhahaha

## Camera

Happily, I had written some code for spinning the camera in the previous project, so all I had to do was add pan and zoom.  It works really nicely!
