# Moving to 3D

So far, the game engine has been 2D.  Everything occurs on a flat map, and the pathing algorithm only tracked points with (x,y).  There was an awkward conversion into and out of map coordinates as well.

So now I have upgraded everything to 3-vectors, wrote some wrappers to do the conversion so I never have to care about it again, and got a basic 3D pathing test going.  There are clearly some issues with the pathing algorithm.
